Q1:

Number or words in the given subset
Word embeddings is a dictionary, having 243 key-value pair, which represents the number of words or number  


Q2:

Dimension of the embedding vector for each word


Predicted Country:
Egypt

Predicted Similarity:
0.7626820802688599

Q3:

Yes


Q4:

Yes, because it's 0.76 meaning it's close to 1, meaning the word Egypt is the most close embedding to Athens - Greece + Cairo 


Computed Accuracy:
0.9192082407594425

Q5:

Yes


Q6:

The words in same category or of same meaning have close embeddings, for example:
1- oil, gas, petroleum have close angles between their vectors
2- happy, sad, joyful have close angles between their vectors
3- city, town, village have close angles between their vectors
4- country, continent have close angles between their vectors
also group 3 and 4 are close to each other since they have close meanings(both are about places)
